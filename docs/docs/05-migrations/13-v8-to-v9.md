# Migrating from v8 to v9

This guide provides instructions for migrating to a new version of ibc-go.

There are four sections based on the four potential user groups of this document:

- [Chains](#chains)
- [IBC Apps](#ibc-apps)
- [Relayers](#relayers)
- [IBC Light Clients](#ibc-light-clients)

**Note:** ibc-go supports golang semantic versioning and therefore all imports must be updated on major version releases.

## Chains

- No relevant changes were made in this release.

## IBC Apps

### API removals

The `exported.ChannelI` and `exported.CounterpartyChannelI` interfaces has been removed. Please use the concrete types. 

The functions `GetState()`, `GetOrdering()`, `GetCounterparty()`, `GetConnectionHops()`, `GetVersion()` of the `Channel` type have been removed.
The functions `GetPortID()`, `GetChannelID()` of the `CounterpartyChannel` type have been removed.

### API deprecation notice

The testing package functions `coordinator.Setup`, `coordinator.SetupClients`, `coordinator.SetupConnections`, `coordinator.CreateConnections`, and `coordinator.CreateChannels` have been deprecated and will be removed in v10.
Please use the new functions `path.Setup`, `path.SetupClients`, `path.SetupConnections`, `path.CreateConnections`, `path.CreateChannels`.
